# Application of CNN and C-RNN in EEG Analysis

Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated great capability of classifying images and videos. Recently there has been a growing interest in applying deep learning technologies for medical data analysis. In this paper, we aim at clas- sifying the EEG data related to humanâ€™s neural activities. We mainly implemented three DNN structures, including a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, a shallow CNN architecture, and a convolutional gated recurrent neural network, to process the EEG data. We also explore different activation functions, optimizers and regularization and pooling strategies that may assist in improving both the training speed and the accuracy. In general, our CNN architectures can be optimized to achieve around 68% accuracy, and our RNN architecture can achieve over 55% accuracy for a single subject, and 45% for all.
